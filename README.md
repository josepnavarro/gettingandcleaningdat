### Unzizep in local working directory folder

###  The R script does the following:
###  1. Load training, test & features TXT files
###  2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
###  3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Or the same, all other columns removed.
###  4. Descriptive activity name added to the data set. 
###  5. Labels renamed with descriptive names.   
###  6. Data aggregated with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###  Thanks.
